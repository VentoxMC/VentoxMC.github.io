There are a variety of different ways a team can make \"Value\" or \"Wealth\". In this guide below, some of the methods will be explored. What is Team Value? Team Value is a virtual currency system that Ventox uses to assign a \"value\" to each team on the server based on a number of different factors available to each team. Players, when in a team, can see how much Team Value their team has by looking on their scoreboard under the \"Team\" header. This information is also available in a team's publicly available information . How do Team get Team Value? Team Value is made up of two different \"types\" of Value: Raidable Value and Unraidable Value . Unraidable Value Unraidable Value is Team Value which cannot be stolen by another team. The value earned through this method is entirely protected until the team is disbanded . Wealth Chest The Wealth Chest is a team-based deposit chest that can be found at Spawn . Players are able to deposit Ores & Ore Blocks into the Wealth Chest to gain Unraidable Value. The value of the ores is equal to the value of the ores when they are sold to the Mining-based shop merchant, also found at Spawn . On occasion, the Wealth Chest will have a multiplier which will change the value of deposited ores. Interest When teams have Raidable Value , they can gain a little bit of interest on their value. This interest is classified as Unraidable Value. Interest is calculated based on a variety of factors including: Interest Rate - This is a base rate which is used to calculate interest. This can be upgraded with Core Upgrades . Compound Interest - This is an upgrade that exists into a Team Core . Raidable Value Raidable Value is Team Value which can be stole and destroyed by another team. The value earned through this method is not protected and can be stolen or destroyed when the Team Core is raided. Wealth Shards Wealth Shards are a in-game currency items which players can obtain from completing Server Events or completing Team Quests . Some of the Wealth Shards are a pre-specified amount whereas other Wealth Shards are dynamic and change based on the quantity of Team Value that exists on the server, collectively. In order to redeem a Wealth Shard, a team member must click the Wealth Shard onto their Team Core . Some Wealth Shards have an expiration timer. These Wealth Shards must be redeemed before the timer expires in order to retrieve the value of the shard. Players can right-click on a Wealth Shard to reveal the time remaining. Deposited Items In the Team Core , players can unlock various deposit-based Core Upgrades . Once unlocked, players are able to manually or automatically deposit Ores, Mob Drops, and Crops into the Team Core for Raidable Value. The value of these items is at a percent deduction compared to their shop-counterpart pricing. Physical Blocks There are a variety of physical blocks that have an associated Raidable Value. Some of these blocks include: Utility Blocks (i.e. Grindstone, Anvil, Enchantment Table, Brewing Stand) High-Tier Spawners Decorated Pots Viewing the Team Top Leaderboard Throughout the entire season , players are gaining value for their team. This value is automatically applied to a Team Top Leaderboard which players can view at anypoint in a team. /team top [page number] - Access to view the Team Top Leaderboard. Competitive Results During each season , the goal on Ventox is for teams to aquire the most amount of Team Value. Near the end of each season , a \"Cutoff Period\" will be announced on the Ventox Discord . This \"Cutoff Period\" will disclose the window of when a staff member will \"Call Team Top\", ending the season . At a random point within the disclosed window, a staff member will take screenshots of the Team Top Leaderboard and will announce the results in the Ventox Discord . This concludes the season . Competitive Prizes The Top Three Teams will receive prizes for winning a Ventox Season . Team Top 1 will receive: A Custom Title with their Team name (for each member) 1x Position #1 Title (and role in Discord) 10x Team Boxes Team Top 2 will receive: A Custom Title with their Team name (for each member) 1x Position #2 Title (and role in Discord) 5x Team Boxes Team Top 3 will receive: A Custom Title with their Team name (for each member) 1x Position #1 Title (and role in Discord) 3x Team Boxes Special Competitive Prizes On occasion, some players will sponsor specific rewards.
