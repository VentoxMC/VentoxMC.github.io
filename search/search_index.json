The upgrades include: Deposit Wealth - Allows players to use the Deposit Wealth functionality Auto Deposit - Allows the Team Core to accept Hopper Input for Depositing Items Entry Alerts - Allows the Team Core to automatically detect nearby players Compound Interest - Allows the Interest Calculation to use Compound Interest Formulas Reinforced Core - Requires a player to use 5x Item Wrenches to destroy a Team Core Core Load - Allows the Team Core to automatically load the territory chunks Core Effects Team Cores can provide team members with positive potion effects to give them an advantage when they're in team territory.

Auto Deposit Another primary function of the Team Core is to automatically detect Hopper Input into the Team Core, extracting Ores, Mob Drops and Crops and converting them into Raidable Value .

Core Claims With a Team Core, teams can decide if they wish for their territory to be Claimed or Unclaimed . By default, all Team Cores are Unclaimed . Unclaimed Cores When a Team Core is unclaimed, it is not protected . This means that any player on the server can break blocks leading into your base, open doors and steal from your containers.

Claimed Cores When a Team Core is claimed, it is protected once a team has at least 1x Team Crystal . This means that players on the server cannot break blocks leading into your base as well as they cannot open doors, trapdoors or fence gates. Players can open containers such as chests, so ensure that your entire base is blocked in without any open doorways leading into your claims. While a Team Core is claimed, the Team Core will register placed blocks ranging between Y-level 0 to Y-level 64.

There are a variety of different ways a team can make \"Value\" or \"Wealth\". In this guide below, some of the methods will be explored. What is Team Value? Team Value is a virtual currency system that Ventox uses to assign a \"value\" to each team on the server based on a number of different factors available to each team. Players, when in a team, can see how much Team Value their team has by looking on their scoreboard under the \"Team\" header. This information is also available in a team's publicly available information . How do Team get Team Value? Team Value is made up of two different types of Value: Raidable Value and Unraidable Value . Unraidable Value Unraidable Value is Team Value which cannot be stolen by another team. The value earned through this method is entirely protected until the team is disbanded . Wealth Chest The Wealth Chest is a team-based deposit chest that can be found at Spawn . Players are able to deposit Ores & Ore Blocks into the Wealth Chest to gain Unraidable Value. The value of the ores is equal to the value of the ores when they are sold to the Mining-based shop merchant, also found at Spawn . On occasion, the Wealth Chest will have a multiplier which will change the value of deposited ores. Interest When teams have Raidable Value , they can gain a little bit of interest on their value. This interest is classified as Unraidable Value. Interest is calculated based on a variety of factors including: Interest Rate - This is the rate that is used in calculations. This can be upgraded with a Team Core . Compound Interest - This is an Core Upgrade that exists in a Team Core . Raidable Value Raidable Value is Team Value which can be stole and destroyed by another team. The value earned through this method is not protected and can be stolen or destroyed when the Team Core is raided. Wealth Shards Wealth Shards are a in-game currency items which players can obtain from completing Server Events or completing Team Quests . Players can also purchase Wealth Shards from the Team Specialist Shop, found at Spawn . Each purchased Wealth Shard costs $100,000 and results in a Wealth Shard worth $50,000 Wealth. Some of the Wealth Shards are a pre-specified amount whereas other Wealth Shards are dynamic and change based on the quantity of Team Value that exists on the server, collectively. In order to redeem a Wealth Shard, a team member must click the Wealth Shard onto their Team Core . Some Wealth Shards have an expiration timer. These Wealth Shards must be redeemed before the timer expires in order to retrieve the value of the shard. Players can right-click on a Wealth Shard to reveal the time remaining. Deposited Items In the Team Core , players can unlock various deposit-based Core Upgrades . Once unlocked, players are able to manually or automatically deposit Ores, Mob Drops and Crops into the Team Core for Raidable Value. The value of these items is at a percent deduction compared to their shop-counterpart pricing. Physical Blocks There are a variety of physical blocks that have an associated Raidable Value. In order for these blocks to count toward's a Teams Wealth, they must be placed down within the territory of a Team Core . For Unclaimed Bases , the blocks must be placed between Y-level -64 and Y-level 64. For Claimed Bases , the blocks must be placed between Y-level 0 and Y-level 64. Some of these blocks include: Utility Blocks (i.e. Grindstone, Anvil, Enchantment Table, Brewing Stand, Hoppers) High-Tier Spawners Decorated Pots Viewing the Team Top Leaderboard Throughout the entire season , players are gaining value for their team. This value is automatically applied to a Team Top Leaderboard which players can view at anypoint in a team. /team top [page number] - Access to view the Team Top Leaderboard. Competitive Results During each season , the goal on Ventox is for teams to aquire the most amount of Team Value. Near the end of each season , a \"Cutoff Period\" will be announced on the Ventox Discord . This \"Cutoff Period\" will disclose the window of when a staff member will \"Call Team Top\", ending the season . At a -random- point within the disclosed window, a staff member will take screenshots of the Team Top Leaderboard and will announce the results in the Ventox Discord . This concludes the season .
