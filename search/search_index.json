Some of these worlds reset each \"season\" whereas other worlds never change. In the guide below, each element of the Ventox Map and a Ventox Season will be explored. Seasons In order to ensure a fresh gameplay experience on Ventox, we have split the calendar year into \"seasons\". Each season typically lasts for 2 weeks of competitive gameplay . After a season has ended , there may be up to 1 week where the server remains online, however there is no competitive gameplay . This allows players to interact with each other in a more causal aspect as well as test out features and gameplay styles without risking a competitive disadvantage. Speciality Seasons On occasion, there will be a speciality season. These seasons usually correlate to holidays. Speciality seasons typically include limited-time content. Some examples of speciality seasons include Halloween and Christmas. Ventox Map The Ventox Map is made up of three individual worlds. Each of these worlds have a specific function and purpose. Raiding World The Raiding World is the default world that everyone spawns into when they first join Ventox. In this world, players can find Spawn . There are also Roads which extend from Spawn into the wild. The Raiding World is also home to Team Bases as it's the only world where players can actually modify the landscape. The Raiding World is completely reset to a brand new state for each season . Spawn Spawn is the first landmark that each player will see when they join Ventox for the first time. Spawn is a centralized safezone where players can interact with NPCs and Merchants as well as safely interact with other players. PvP is completely disabled in Spawn. The Ventox Spawn is home to many of the most important Ventox functions. Players can find Shop NPCs where they can buy and sell various items Players can upgrade spawners at the Spawner Mason Players can access quests at the Elite Quester Players can purchase Team Crystals and purchase Team Cores Players can redeem Banknotes & XP Bottles at the Banker Players can access companions and stables Beyond these important functions, Spawn is also home to a public Enchantment Room with maximized enchantment tables and anvils. If players are needing to repair their items or do some enchanting, this room is very important. It can be found in the Northwest Quadrant of Spawn. Spawn also displays each of the server's Loot Boxes , where to obtain these boxes and what's inside of the each Loot Box . Overall, Spawn is a critical \"safezone\" for players. Players should familize themselves with Spawn. Roads Roads are server-protected builds that extend from Spawn into the wild. While a player is on a road, they will get a Permanent Speed II effect. This helps players travel into and out of Spawn quickly. Players need to be careful as roads are pvp-zones meaning that they are risky and leave you vulnerable for attack. Bases The Raiding World is the only world which players can directly modify by placing and destroying blocks. In doing so, the Raiding World is the only world where teams can create a base, hence it's the only world where players can also raid each other. You can refer to the Raiding a Team Core Guide to assist you in how to raid a Team Core. The Nexus The Nexus is an Event World that hosts all the functional landmarks and in-game events for players to experience. The Nexus is the only world where players can fish , brush , fight supply drops , kill bosses or capture the Summit . The Nexus is a pvpzone meaning that it's risky to travel there and leaves you vulnerable for attack. Accessing The Nexus Players can enter The Nexus with /landmarks or /warps . Leaving The Nexus In order to leave The Nexus , players must find an Exit Travellers . These Exit Travellers are NPCs that can be found along pathways throughout The Nexus . Once an Exit Traveller has been found, a player can right-click on the NPC and confirm their exit. Once the teleportation has been completed, the player will be teleported back to the Raiding World , exactly to the point that they entered The Nexus from. During this exit process, the player will glow leaving your vulnerable for attack and spotting. Be sure to check your surroundings for any hazards before attempting to leave The Nexus . Nexus Landmarks The Nexus lays host to many of the top gameplay mechanics on Ventox. The follow sub-section will explore these various landmarks. Shady Shallows Tracking Landmarks Players can track landmarks and points of interest in each of the worlds by using /landmarks or /warps . When the player is in the Raiding World , players will be able to: Track their Bed Location - if they have a bed Track their Team Core - if they have a Team Core Track Spawn Teleport into The Nexus When the player is in The Nexus , players will be able to: Track the Shady Shallows Fishing Lake Track the Shady Deposits Gold Deposit Track the Abandon Shafts Mineshaft Track the Pit of Heroes Boss Arena Track The Summit PvP Arena Track the Deserted Ruins Excavation Area Track The Nether Cavern Portal Nether Portal In the Halloween season , players are able to: Track the Pumpkin Pardise Fishing Lake and Pumpkin Patch In the Christmas season , players are able to : Track the Snowdrift Shores Fishing Lake Track the Sugar Rush Ridge Sugar Cane Field When the player is in The Nether Cavern , players will be able to: Track the Hellfire Hollows Nether Mineshaft","title":"Map & Landmarks"},{"location":"help/map/#the-ventox-map","text":"The Ventox Universe is made of several different worlds that consist of different landmarks and functions.

There are a variety of different ways a team can make \"Value\" or \"Wealth\". In this guide below, some of the methods will be explored. What is Team Value? Team Value is a virtual currency system that Ventox uses to assign a \"value\" to each team on the server based on a number of different factors available to each team. Players, when in a team, can see how much Team Value their team has by looking on their scoreboard under the \"Team\" header. This information is also available in a team's publicly available information . How do Team get Team Value? A Team Core is required to get Team Value. Team Value is made up of two different types of Value: Raidable Value and Unraidable Value . Unraidable Value Unraidable Value is Team Value which cannot be stolen by another team. The value earned through this method is entirely protected until the team is disbanded . Wealth Chest The Wealth Chest is a team-based deposit chest that can be found at Spawn . Players are able to deposit Ores & Ore Blocks into the Wealth Chest to gain Unraidable Value. The value of the ores is equal to the value of the ores when they are sold to the Mining-based shop merchant, also found at Spawn . On occasion, the Wealth Chest will have a multiplier which will change the value of deposited ores. Interest When teams have Raidable Value , they can gain a little bit of interest on their value. This interest is classified as Unraidable Value. Interest is calculated based on a variety of factors including: Interest Rate - This is the rate that is used in calculations. This can be upgraded with a Team Core . Compound Interest - This is an Core Upgrade that exists in a Team Core . Raidable Value Raidable Value is Team Value which can be stole and destroyed by another team. The value earned through this method is not protected and can be stolen or destroyed when the Team Core is raided. Wealth Shards Wealth Shards are a in-game currency items which players can obtain from completing Server Events or completing Team Quests . Players can also purchase Wealth Shards from the Team Specialist Shop, found at Spawn . Each purchased Wealth Shard costs $100,000 and results in a Wealth Shard worth $50,000 Wealth. Some of the Wealth Shards are a pre-specified amount whereas other Wealth Shards are dynamic and change based on the quantity of Team Value that exists on the server, collectively. In order to redeem a Wealth Shard, a team member must click the Wealth Shard onto their Team Core . Some Wealth Shards have an expiration timer. These Wealth Shards must be redeemed before the timer expires in order to retrieve the value of the shard. Players can right-click on a Wealth Shard to reveal the time remaining. Deposited Items In the Team Core , players can unlock various deposit-based Core Upgrades . Once unlocked, players are able to manually or automatically deposit Ores, Mob Drops and Crops into the Team Core for Raidable Value. The value of these items is at a percent deduction compared to their shop-counterpart pricing. Physical Blocks There are a variety of physical blocks that have an associated Raidable Value. In order for these blocks to count toward's a Teams Wealth, they must be placed down within the territory of a Team Core . For Unclaimed Bases , the blocks must be placed between Y-level -64 and Y-level 64. For Claimed Bases , the blocks must be placed between Y-level 0 and Y-level 64. Some of these blocks include: Utility Blocks (i.e. Grindstone, Anvil, Enchantment Table, Brewing Stand, Hoppers) High-Tier Spawners Decorated Pots Viewing the Team Top Leaderboard Throughout the entire season , players are gaining value for their team. This value is automatically applied to a Team Top Leaderboard which players can view at anypoint in a team. /team top [page number] - Access to view the Team Top Leaderboard. Competitive Results During each season , the goal on Ventox is for teams to aquire the most amount of Team Value. Near the end of each season , a \"Cutoff Period\" will be announced on the Ventox Discord . This \"Cutoff Period\" will disclose the window of when a staff member will \"Call Team Top\", ending the season . At a -random- point within the disclosed window, a staff member will take screenshots of the Team Top Leaderboard and will announce the results in the Ventox Discord . This concludes the season . Competitive Prizes The Top Three Teams will receive prizes for winning a Ventox Season . Team Top 1 will receive: A Custom Title with their Team name (for each member) 1x Position #1 Title (and role in Discord) 10x Team Boxes Team Top 2 will receive: A Custom Title with their Team name (for each member) 1x Position #2 Title (and role in Discord) 5x Team Boxes Team Top 3 will receive: A Custom Title with their Team name (for each member) 1x Position #1 Title (and role in Discord) 3x Team Boxes Special Competitive Prizes On occasion, some players will sponsor specific rewards.
