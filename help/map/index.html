                <h1 id="the-ventox-map">The Ventox Map</h1>
<p>The Ventox Universe is made of several different worlds that consist of different landmarks and functions. Some of these worlds reset each "season" whereas other worlds never change. In the guide below, each element of the Ventox Map and a Ventox Season will be explored.</p>
<h2 id="seasons">Seasons</h2>
<p>In order to ensure a fresh gameplay experience on Ventox, we have split the calendar year into "seasons". Each season typically lasts for <strong>2 weeks</strong> of <a href="http://docs.ventoxmc.com/help/teamtop">competitive gameplay</a>.</p>
<p>After a <a href="http://docs.ventoxmc.com/help/teamtop#competitive-results">season has ended</a>, there may be up to <strong>1 week</strong> where the server remains online, however there is no <a href="http://docs.ventoxmc.com/help/teamtop">competitive gameplay</a>. This allows players to interact with each other in a more causal aspect as well as test out features and gameplay styles without risking a competitive disadvantage.</p>
<h3 id="speciality-seasons">Speciality Seasons</h3>
<p>On occasion, there will be a speciality season. These seasons usually correlate to holidays, may be shorter or longer than usual, and typically include limited-time exclusive content specific to the themed season. Speciality seasons usually include new temporary builds as well as more cosmetics.</p>
<p>Some examples of speciality seasons include Halloween and Christmas.</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="ventox-map">Ventox Map</h2>
<p>The Ventox Map is made up of three individual worlds. Each of these worlds have a specific function and purpose.</p>
<h3 id="raiding-world">Raiding World</h3>
<p>The <em>Raiding World</em> is the default world that everyone spawns into when they first join Ventox. In this world, players can find <a href="http://docs.ventoxmc.com/help/map#spawn">Spawn</a>. There are also <a href="http://docs.ventoxmc.com/help/map#roads">Roads</a> which extend from <a href="http://docs.ventoxmc.com/help/map#spawn">Spawn</a> into the wild.</p>
<p>The <em>Raiding World</em> is also home to Team Bases as it's the only world where players can actually modify the landscape.</p>
<p>The <em>Raiding World</em> is completely reset to a brand new state for each <a href="http://docs.ventoxmc.com/help/map#seasons">season</a>.</p>
<h4 id="spawn">Spawn</h4>
<p>Spawn is the first landmark that each player will see when they join Ventox for the first time. Spawn is a centralized safezone where players can interact with NPCs and Merchants as well as safely interact with other players. PvP is completely disabled in Spawn.</p>
<p>The Ventox Spawn is home to many of the most important Ventox functions.</p>
<ul>
<li>Players can find Shop NPCs where they can buy and sell various items</li>
<li>Players can <a href="http://docs.ventoxmc.com/help/-----------">upgrade spawners</a> at the Spawner Mason</li>
<li>Players can access <a href="http://docs.ventoxmc.com/help/quests">quests</a> at the Elite Quester</li>
<li>Players can <a href="http://docs.ventoxmc.com/help/teamcores#team-crystals">purchase Team Crystals</a> and <a href="http://docs.ventoxmc.com/help/teamcores">purchase Team Cores</a></li>
<li>Players can <a href="http://docs.ventoxmc.com/help/-----------">redeem Banknotes &amp; XP Bottles</a> at the Banker</li>
<li>Players can access <a href="http://docs.ventoxmc.com/help/-----------">companions and stables</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Beyond these important functions, Spawn is also home to a public Enchantment Room with maximized enchantment tables and anvils. If players are needing to repair their items or do some enchanting, this room is very important. It can be found in the Northwest Quadrant of Spawn.</p>
<p>Spawn also displays each of the server's <a href="http://docs.ventoxmc.com/help/-----------">Loot Boxes</a>, where to obtain these boxes and what's inside of the each <a href="http://docs.ventoxmc.com/help/-----------">Loot Box</a>.</p>
<p>Overall, Spawn is a critical "safezone" for players. Players should familize themselves with Spawn.</p>
<h4 id="roads">Roads</h4>
<p>Roads are server-protected builds that extend from <a href="http://docs.ventoxmc.com/help/map#spawn">Spawn</a> into the wild. While a player is on a road, they will get a Permanent Speed II effect. This helps players travel into and out of <a href="http://docs.ventoxmc.com/help/map#spawn">Spawn</a> quickly.</p>
<p>Players need to be careful as roads are pvp-zones meaning that they are risky and leave you vulnerable for attack.</p>
<h4 id="bases">Bases</h4>
<p>The <em>Raiding World</em> is the only world which players can directly modify by placing and destroying blocks. In doing so, the <em>Raiding World</em> is the only world where teams can create a base, hence it's the only world where players can also raid each other.</p>
<p>You can refer to the <a href="http://docs.ventoxmc.com/help/teamcores#raiding-a-team-core">Raiding a Team Core</a> Guide to assist you in how to raid a Team Core.</p>
<h3 id="the-nexus">The Nexus</h3>
<p><em>The Nexus</em> is an Event World that hosts all the functional landmarks and in-game events for players to experience. <em>The Nexus</em> is the only world where players can <a href="http://docs.ventoxmc.com/help/mechanics#fishing">fish</a>, <a href="http://docs.ventoxmc.com/help/mechanics#panning">pan</a>, <a href="http://docs.ventoxmc.com/help/-----------">brush</a>, fight <a href="http://docs.ventoxmc.com/help/-----------">supply drops</a>, kill <a href="http://docs.ventoxmc.com/help/-----------">bosses</a> or <a href="http://docs.ventoxmc.com/help/events#summit">capture the Summit</a>.</p>
<p><em>The Nexus</em> is primarily pvp-free, however there are certain regions and events that can enable pvp. On the scoreboard, there is an indicator to display whether or not you are vulnerable for attack.</p>
<h4 id="accessing-the-nexus">Accessing The Nexus</h4>
<p>Players can enter <em>The Nexus</em> by using <code>/landmarks</code> or <code>/warps</code> while in the <em>Raiding World</em>, at <a href="http://docs.ventoxmc.com/help/map#spawn">Spawn</a>.</p>
<h4 id="leaving-the-nexus">Leaving The Nexus</h4>
<p>In order to leave <em>The Nexus</em>, players must find an <strong>Exit Traveller</strong>. These <strong>Exit Travellers</strong> are NPCs that can be found along pathways throughout <em>The Nexus</em>. Once an <strong>Exit Traveller</strong> has been found, a player can right-click on the NPC and confirm their exit. This will start a teleportation timer.</p>
<p>Once the teleportation has been completed, the player will be teleported back to the <em>Raiding World</em>, exactly to the point that they entered <em>The Nexus</em> from.</p>
<p>During this exit process, the player will glow leaving your vulnerable for attack and spotting. Be sure to check your surroundings for any hazards before attempting to leave <em>The Nexus</em>.</p>
<h4 id="nexus-landmarks">Nexus Landmarks</h4>
<p><em>The Nexus</em> lays host to many of the top gameplay mechanics on Ventox. The follow sub-section will explore these various landmarks.</p>
