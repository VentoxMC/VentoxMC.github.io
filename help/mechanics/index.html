This luck meter improves the chance at finding <a href="http://docs.ventoxmc.com/help/mechanics#stock-rewards">Stock Rewards</a>.</p>
<p>There are <strong>4x Luck Levels</strong>.</p>
<ul>
<li>Low - At least 0x Players Fishing</li>
<li>Medium - At least 15x Players Fishing</li>
<li>High - At least 30x Players Fishing</li>
<li>Divine - At least 50x Players Fishing</li>
</ul>
<p>Each player fishing counts as 1x Player.</p>
<p>Players with the <a href="http://docs.ventoxmc.com/help/teams#-----------------">Trailblazer Rank</a> count as 2x Players.</p>
<p>Players with the "Extra Luck" <a href="http://docs.ventoxmc.com/help/teams#-----------------">Skill Perk</a> count as +1 Players.</p>
<p>Team members with the "+1 Luck" <a href="http://docs.ventoxmc.com/help/teamcores#summit-perks">Summit Perk</a> count as +1 Players.</p>
<h3 id="ice-pick">Ice Pick</h3>
<p>In the <a href="http://docs.ventoxmc.com/help/map#speciality-seasons">Christmas season</a>, players can fish at the <a href="http://docs.ventoxmc.com/help/map#snowdrift-shores">Snowdrift Shores</a>. In order to fish, players must <em>break the ice</em> to reach the water and fish below. Ice Picks can be purchased from the Shop Merchants at the <a href="http://docs.ventoxmc.com/help/map#snowdrift-shores">Snowdrift Shores</a> during the <a href="http://docs.ventoxmc.com/help/map#speciality-seasons">speciality season</a>.</p>

<h2 id="panning">Panning</h2>
<p>On Ventox, players can pan at a designated gold deposit, including the <a href="http://docs.ventoxmc.com/help/map#shady-deposits">Shady Deposits</a> in <a href="http://docs.ventoxmc.com/help/map#the-nexus">The Nexus</a>.</p>
<h3 id="gold-pans">Gold Pans</h3>
<p>Gold panning is a unique mechanic on Ventox. Before a player can gold pan, they must obtain a custom Gold Pan.</p>
<ul>
<li>Gold Pan - 5 seconds - Buyable at landmarks and <a href="http://docs.ventoxmc.com/help/map#spawn">Spawn</a> </li>
</ul>
<p>Once a player has obtained a gold pan, they can navigate to a gold deposit such as the <a href="http://docs.ventoxmc.com/help/map#shady-deposits">Shady Deposits</a>. Once at the landmark, players can search for <em>Rooted Dirt Blocks</em>. Once these blocks have been identified a player can right-click on the block with the gold pan to "pan" the block. The player is unable to move while panning a block, so it does leave the player vulnerable.</p>
<p>Once the panning completes, the player will either receive an item or nothing. Unforunately, sometimes the panning action will not find any items in the blocks. In either situation, the <em>Rooted Dirt Blocks</em> will change into normal dirt blocks. After a random amount of time, the block will change back to a <em>Rooted Dirt Block</em> so it can be panned again.</p>
<p>Players can reduce the fail rate of Gold Pans with the "Reduce Fail Rate" <a href="http://docs.ventoxmc.com/help/teams#-----------------">Skill Perk</a>.</p>
<p>Each panning operation will only find a single item, if it finds an item at all. This can be improved with the "Multifind" <a href="http://docs.ventoxmc.com/help/teams#-----------------">Skill Perk</a>.</p>
<h3 id="gold-deposit-states">Gold Deposit States</h3>
<p>The Gold Deposits have two different states: <strong>Overpanned</strong> and <strong>Restocked</strong>. In either state, players can still pan.</p>
<p>In the <strong>Overpanned</strong> state, which is the default state, players can find a <a href="http://docs.ventoxmc.com/help/mechanics#types-of-panning-loot">variety of items</a> including trash items, common and uncommon gold. Every few hours, the landmarks will naturally become <strong>Restocked</strong>. During this <strong>Restocked</strong> state, players can find a <a href="http://docs.ventoxmc.com/help/mechanics#types-of-panning-loot">variety of items</a> including trash items and gold ranging from uncommon to divine rarity. When the Shady Deposits is <strong>Replenished</strong>, players can also participate in an automatic <a href="http://docs.ventoxmc.com/help/mechanics#weighted-panning-competition">weighted panning competition</a> that lasts for the entire restockment.</p>
<p>Players can purchase a <a href="http://store.ventoxmc.com">Deposit Restocker</a> which, when activated, will instantly set the landmark's state to <strong>Restocked</strong>.</p>
<h3 id="types-of-panning-loot">Types of Panning Loot</h3>
<p>While Panning at a landmark, players can find a variety of unique items.</p>
<h4 id="trash-items_1">Trash Items</h4>
<p>There are a few trash items, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fool's Gold</li>
<li>Ancient Shell</li>
<li>Quartz</li>
<li>Shattered Sapphire</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="gold">Gold</h4>
<p>There are <strong>4x Types of Gold</strong>.</p>
<ul>
<li>Gold Dust</li>
<li>Gold Nugget</li>
<li>Gold Chunk</li>
<li>Gold Ingot</li>
</ul>
<p>The fish can come in different rarities. These rarities will affect the sell price of the fish. Some of the rarities include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Common</li>
<li>Uncommon</li>
<li>Rare</li>
<li>Epic</li>
<li>Legendary</li>
<li>Divine</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="treasure-items_1">Treasure Items</h4>
<p>There are a few treasure items including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Bottles of XP</li>
<li>Banknotes</li>
<li><a href="http://docs.ventoxmc.com/help/mechanics#treasure-lockpicks">Treasure Lockpicks</a></li>

<li>Diamond</li>
<li>Emerald</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="weighted-panning-competition">Weighted Panning Competition</h3>
<p>When a landmark is in it's <a href="http://docs.ventoxmc.com/help/mechanics#gold-deposit-states"><strong>Restocked</strong> state</a>, there is a Panning Competition going on. When you pan, the gold will be assigned a random weight. This weight helps determine the price of the gold, but will also contribute to the competition.</p>
<p>At the end of the restockment, the Top Three Players with the heaviest gold will be given a reward.</p>
<ol>
<li>2x Prospector's Bag</li>
<li>1x Prospector's Bag</li>
<li>1x Fisher's Lost Supplies</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="mining">Mining</h2>
<p>On Ventox, mining ores is very important to progress further in the game. Players are able to mine anywhere in the <a href="http://docs.ventoxmc.com/help/map#raiding-world">Raiding World</a> or at a designated mineshaft. There are <strong>2x designated mineshafts</strong> on Ventox including the <a href="http://docs.ventoxmc.com/help/map#abandon-shafts">Abandon Shafts</a> mineshaft in <a href="http://docs.ventoxmc.com/help/map#the-nexus">The Nexus</a> and the <a href="http://docs.ventoxmc.com/help/map#hellfire-hollows">Hellfire Hollows</a> mineshaft in <a href="http://docs.ventoxmc.com/help/map#the-nether-cavern">The Nether Cavern</a>.</p>
<p>As mining in the <a href="http://docs.ventoxmc.com/help/map#raiding-world">Raiding World</a> is no different than in normal Minecraft, with the exception of a few <a href="http://docs.ventoxmc.com/help/teams#-----------------">Skill Perk</a> requirements, the majority of this section will focus on the unique features of the mineshafts.</p>
<h3 id="elevator-operators">Elevator Operators</h3>
<h4 id="abandon-shafts"><a href="http://docs.ventoxmc.com/help/map#abandon-shafts">Abandon Shafts</a></h4>
<p>In order to navigate between different layers of the <a href="http://docs.ventoxmc.com/help/map#abandon-shafts">Abandon Shafts</a>, there are Elevator Operator NPCs scattered throughout the mineshaft. Upon reaching an Elevator Operator, players can right-click to commence a teleportation between the different layers of the mineshaft. During the teleportation, the player will glow leaving them vulnerable for discovery and attacks. Ensure you check your surrounding areas before using an Elevator Operator.</p>
<h4 id="hellfire-hollows"><a href="http://docs.ventoxmc.com/help/map#hellfire-hollows">Hellfire Hollows</a></h4>
<p>In order to navigate between different regions of the <a href="http://docs.ventoxmc.com/help/map#hellfire-hollows">Hellfire Hollows</a>, there are Gate Keeper NPCs scattered throughout the mineshaft. Upon reaching a Gate Keeper, players can right-click to commence a teleportation between the different regions of the mineshaft. During the teleportation, the player will glow leaving them vulnerable for discovery and attacks. Ensure you check your surrounding areas before using a Gate Keeper.</p>
<h3 id="mineshaft-layers">Mineshaft Layers</h3>
<h4 id="abandon-shafts_1"><a href="http://docs.ventoxmc.com/help/map#abandon-shafts">Abandon Shafts</a></h4>
<p>The <a href="http://docs.ventoxmc.com/help/map#abandon-shafts">Abandon Shafts</a> is split into <strong>7x Unique Layers</strong> of ores.</p>
<ul>
<li>Layer 1: Coal - Regeneration Rate of 45+ seconds</li>
<li>Layer 2: Coal, Iron - Regeneration Rate of 45+ seconds</li>
<li>Layer 3: Iron, Copper - Regeneration Rate of 60+ seconds</li>
<li>Layer 4: Copper, Gold, Redstone - Regeneration Rate of 60+ seconds</li>
<li>Layer 5: Gold, Redstone, Lapis - Regeneration Rate of 75+ seconds</li>
<li>Layer 6: Redstone, Lapis, Diamond - Regeneration Rate of 75+ seconds</li>
<li>Layer 7: Lapis, Diamond, Emerald - Regeneration Rate of 90+ seconds</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="hellfire-hollows_1"><a href="http://docs.ventoxmc.com/help/map#hellfire-hollows">Hellfire Hollows</a></h4>
<p>The <a href="http://docs.ventoxmc.com/help/map#hellfire-hollows">Hellfire Hollows</a> is split into <strong>2x Unique Regions</strong> of ores.</p>
<ul>
<li>Region 1: Hellfire Hollow - Consists of Nether Quartz, Nether Gold and Glowstone Geodes</li>
<li>Region 2: Hellfire Hollow Depths - Consists of Nether Quartz, Nether Gold and Ancient Debris Spikes</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="ore-regeneration">Ore Regeneration</h3>
<h4 id="abandon-shafts_2"><a href="http://docs.ventoxmc.com/help/map#abandon-shafts">Abandon Shafts</a></h4>
<p>In the <a href="http://docs.ventoxmc.com/help/map#abandon-shafts">Abandon Shafts</a>, players can break any <strong>Ore Block</strong> as well as <strong>Cobblestone</strong> and <strong>Cobbled Deepslate</strong>. Once a block has been mined, it will turn to bedrock. After a random amount of time, the block will randomly change into one of those three blocks.</p>
<p>If the block is <strong>Cobblestone</strong> or <strong>Cobbled Deepslate</strong>, the regeneration is said to have "failed". In order for this block to regenerate, hopefully successfully, a player must destroy the block again and repeat this cycle. Players can purchase a <a href="http://store.ventoxmc.com">Mineshaft Regenerator</a> which, when activated, will instantly replace all the failed blocks with successful ores.</p>
<p>Once a day, the landmark will automatically regenerate all the failed blocks.</p>
<p>The fail rate can be reduced with the "Reduced Stone Rate" <a href="http://docs.ventoxmc.com/help/teams#-----------------">Skill Perk</a>.</p>
<h4 id="hellfire-hollows_2"><a href="http://docs.ventoxmc.com/help/map#hellfire-hollows">Hellfire Hollows</a></h4>
<p>In the <a href="http://docs.ventoxmc.com/help/map#hellfire-hollows">Hellfire Hollows</a>, players can break any <strong>Ore Block</strong> as well as <strong>Stripped Mangrove Wood</strong>. Once a block has been mined, it will turn to bedrock. After a random amount of time, the block will randomly change into one of those three blocks.</p>
<p>If the block is <strong>Stripped Mangrove Wood</strong>, the regeneration is said to have "failed". In order for this block to regenerate, hopefully successfully, a player must destroy the block again and repeat this cycle. Players can purchase a <a href="http://store.ventoxmc.com">Mineshaft Regenerator</a> which, when activated, will instantly replace all the failed blocks with successful ores.</p>
<p>Once a day, the landmark will automatically regenerate all the failed blocks.</p>
<h3 id="mineshaft-refinery">Mineshaft Refinery</h3>
<p>The mineshafts have two different states for the "Material Refinery" that exists within the deep caverns: <strong>Inactive</strong> and <strong>Active</strong>. In either state, players can still fish.</p>
<p>In the <strong>Inactive</strong> state, which is the default state, players can mine <strong>Ore Blocks</strong> and <strong>Ore Blocks</strong> will regenerate. Once a day, the landmark's Material Refinery will become <strong>Active</strong>. During this <strong>Active</strong> state, players can mine <strong>Ore Blocks</strong>, however, <strong>Full Ore Blocks</strong> such as Diamond Blocks may regenerate, amongst the normal <strong>Ore Block</strong> regeneration. While the mineshaft is in an <strong>Active</strong> state, the block regeneration speed will also be faster.</p>
<h3 id="fossilized-chests">Fossilized Chests</h3>
<p>Players can obtain Fossilized Chests while mining, once they've acquired the proper <a href="http://docs.ventoxmc.com/help/teams#-----------------">Skill Perk</a>. Fossilized Chests are rare items that are locked initially, requiring an <a href="http://docs.ventoxmc.com/help/mechanics#ancient-lockpicks">Ancient Lockpick</a> to unlock the chest. The Fossilized Chests contain a variety of unique items, including the Fortune IV Enchantments.</p>
<h4 id="ancient-lockpicks">Ancient Lockpicks</h4>
<p>In order to open a Fossilized Chest, players must obtain a Ancient Lockpick. Ancient Lockpicks can be obtained while doing <a href="http://docs.ventoxmc.com/help/mechanics#panning">Gold Panning</a>, <a href="http://docs.ventoxmc.com/help/-----------">Archeology</a> and <a href="http://docs.ventoxmc.com/help/-----------">Voting</a>.</p>
<p>Each Ancient Lockpick has a specified chance to work. Players can take the lockpick and drag-n-drop it onto a Fossilized Chest. If the lockpick fails, the lockpick will break and the Fossilized Chest will stay closed. If the lockpick is successful, the lockpick will still break, but the Fossilized Chest will be opened.</p>
<h3 id="regeneration-meter">Regeneration Meter</h3>
<p>While at a mineshaft, there is a server-wide Regeneration Meter. As players mine at the landmark, this regeneration meter will increase. The more players mining concurrently, the high the regeneration meter will be. This regeneration meter improves the ore regeneration speed.</p>
<p>There are <strong>4x Regeneration Levels</strong>.</p>
<ul>
<li>Normal - At least 0x Players Mining</li>
<li>Enhanced - At least 15x Players Mining</li>
<li>High - At least 30x Players Mining</li>
<li>Divine - At least 50x Players Mining</li>
</ul>
<p>Each player mining counts as 1x Player.</p>
<p>Players with the <a href="http://docs.ventoxmc.com/help/teams#-----------------">Trailblazer Rank</a> count as 2x Players.</p>
<p>Players with the "Extra Regeneration" <a href="http://docs.ventoxmc.com/help/teams#-----------------">Skill Perk</a> count as +1 Players.</p>
<p>Team members with the "+1 Regeneration" <a href="http://docs.ventoxmc.com/help/teamcores#summit-perks">Summit Perk</a> count as +1 Players.</p>
